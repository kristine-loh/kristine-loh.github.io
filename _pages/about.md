Kristine Q. Loh is a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Engineering Department at Swarthmore College. She received her PhD in Chemical Engineering at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities as a College of Science and Engineering and NSF Graduate Research Fellow. As a member of the Ferry and Kortshagen Groups, her research focused on luminescent solar concentrators for agrivoltaic applications. Her research interests lie in the sustainable production of nanomaterials for renewable energy technologies. As she deeply values accessibility and inclusion in STEM, she dedicated her time to graduate student groups both within her department and beyond, including the university's Graduate Labor Union, the departmental Women+ Group, Science for All, and the departmental Graduate Student Committee. 

She received her Bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering and her Master’s in Materials Science and Engineering alongside a Certificate in Technical Communication and Publishing as a member of the Pennoni Honors College at Drexel University. During her time at Drexel, she was heavily involved in student organizations that supported diversity and inclusion in STEM, including SWE, SASE, and A.O.E. She also participated in the STAR Scholars Program as a Frances Velay Fellow, which sparked her passion for research. Through Drexel's renowned Co-op program, she has two years of industry experience. 

Kristine is from Hialeah, Florida and in her free time, she enjoys travelling, trying new air fryer recipes, and volunteering for K-12 STEM outreach events.
