From student thank you notes:<br/>
> Your speaking inspired me to consider chemical engineering as a career option. You gave me a comprehensive understanding of the skills and subjects in chemical engineering. Thank you for your time.<br/>
> Thank you so much for coming and speaking with [us]. Your talk inspired me a lot as a women who want to get into the engineering field, as a chemical engineer. It fully cleared to me what I want to do and what I should study. Thank you so much.<br/>
> Thank you for speaking to the class. It was very informative and fun to listen to!<br/>
> Thank you so much for not only sharing your career, but your life with us. Your transparency really showed how passionate you are about your field and helped me understand the struggles you have faced. You are an amazing engineer and strong woman.<br/>

From a student's nomination:
> Kristine Loh went above and beyond in our laboratory. She made sure the instructions from the professor were clear and would elaborate on them if need be. This helped me to be able to locate and critically evaluate information in a setting that was often overwhelming and stressful. Kristine treated me with respect and made me feel valued as a fellow woman in engineering, and this led me to acquire skills for effective citizenship and life-long learning. She was very approachable and made sure I knew that there was no such thing as a "dumb" question, which helped to improve my communication skills with superiors.
